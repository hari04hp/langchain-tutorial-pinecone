This is a follow-along tutorial by pinecone.io on LangChain.
* I learnt at https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/ referring https://github.com/pinecone-io/examples/blob/master/learn/generation/langchain/handbook
* Some LLM models are changed and Hugging Face Hub is not tried.
* I only tried OpenAI API with my API key.
* We have to install the required libraries with pip install command.
* I have fixed the deprecation warning in most of the scripts but there is a chance that we might still get it.
